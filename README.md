## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

### Prerequisites

This package requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), npm, Inquirer, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) installed on your machine. You can install these by running the code below on your terminal:

For `npm`

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

For `Node.js`

```bash
npm i node@lts
```

For `Express.js`

```bash
npm i express
```

### Setting Up

Open the project in VS Code and make sure you are in the directory of this application before installing `MySQL2`, `dotenv` and `Sequelize`. To install it, type the commands below on your terminal:

For `MySQL2`

```bash
npm i mysql2
```

For `dotenv`

```bash
npm i dotenv
```

For `Sequelize`

```bash
npm i sequelize
```

You can also open the project in VS Code, make sure you are in the directory of this application and then type the command below on your terminal:

```bash
npm i
```

Once you run this, npm will begin the installation process of all of the current project's dependencies.

## Mock-Up

The following image is an illustration of the schema of the existing tables in the database of this application:

<img src="./assets/images/demo1.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="700px" height="342px" />

## Usage

First you need to seed the database using the command:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Then launch the application by entering the command below on your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the application is launched, GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Tests

### Prerequisites

To test this application, you will need to install [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download).

### Running Tests

Open your terminal, make sure you are in the directory of this application and type the command below to seed data to the database so that you can test the routes.

```bash
npm run seed
```

The following animation shows the application's **GET** routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests ‚ÄúGET tags,‚Äù ‚ÄúGET Categories,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGET All Products.‚Äù.](./assets/demo1.gif)

The following animation shows the application's **GET** routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests ‚ÄúGET tag by id,‚Äù ‚ÄúGET Category by ID,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGET One Product.‚Äù](./assets/demo2.gif)

The following animation shows the application's **POST, PUT, and DELETE** routes for categories being tested in Insomnia:
